# üéôÔ∏è Audio Grammar Analyzer

An advanced audio analysis tool that uses AI to evaluate grammar quality in speech recordings. This project uses OpenAI's Whisper model for speech-to-text transcription, combined with custom grammar analysis algorithms to provide comprehensive assessments of spoken language.

**Live Demo**: [Try Audio Grammar Analyzer on Streamlit Cloud](https://grammarscoreengine-shl.streamlit.app/)

## üöÄ Features

- **Speech-to-Text Transcription**: Uses OpenAI's Whisper model for accurate audio transcription
- **Grammar Analysis**: Evaluates grammar quality based on recognized text patterns
- **Audio Pattern Analysis**: Analyzes speech patterns, pauses, and fluency metrics
- **Combined Scoring**: Provides a comprehensive grammar quality score
- **Detailed Error Detection**: Identifies specific grammar issues in transcribed text
- **Batch Processing**: Process multiple audio files at once
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Visualize results with intuitive charts and gauges
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy file management and analysis

## üìã How It Works

1. **Audio Upload**: Add audio files through the UI or place them in a designated folder
2. **Feature Extraction**: Extract speech patterns, pauses, and other audio metrics
3. **Transcription**: Convert speech to text using Whisper AI
4. **Grammar Analysis**: Analyze transcribed text for grammar errors
5. **Fluency Analysis**: Evaluate speech patterns for fluency indicators
6. **Combined Scoring**: Generate a comprehensive score based on text and audio analysis
7. **Results Visualization**: Display detailed analysis with interactive charts

## üñ•Ô∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- FFmpeg installed on your system
- Used Conda for env creation

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
